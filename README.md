This is the repository for CS50 week 0 project
Michael Butler is a 25 year of Male from Newfoundland and Labrador Canada who is living in Ottawa. I am an indivudal who puts emphasis on friends and family. I am taking this CS50 course to increase my knowledge and to test whether I want to pursue a career path in the computer sciences. During grade school Math and Science were always my best subjects and I tend to think of problems in a very logical way. My university career switched gears into the Humanities but I always felt an affinity towards formal logic. I have always been technologically savvy, but with no formal training. I figure, if I can put my mind to courses such as CS50, then I can determine whether my preconceieved ideas are valid or simiply mistaken.
